        the local TCP stack absorbs server-pushed keepalives silently
        for minutes and the daemon never realises it's already a ghost.

        This loop is the daemon-side half of the contract:
          * Cadence is set by ``_negotiate_heartbeat_interval`` from
            the SSE welcome and stored on ``_heartbeat_interval_seconds``.

            loop is spawned in parallel with the SSE handler that
            processes welcome (the first iteration uses the default,
            every subsequent one uses the negotiated value).
          * The ``await sleep(interval)`` happens BEFORE each re-emit,
            so the first heartbeat fires one interval after the loop
            starts (the post-welcome registration just refreshed
            ``last_seen``; firing again immediately would be wasteful).
          * Each re-emit reuses ``_producer_status_payload`` so we
            stay byte-identical to the registration payload. Central
            is idempotent under repeated setPeerStatus from the same peer.
          * A failed heartbeat is logged at DEBUG, not ERROR: the
            split-brain detector (``_producer_health_loop``) is the
            authoritative recovery path. If central truly dropped us,

    Drops the relay's current connection and re-registers with the

    state where ``/relay-status`` reports ``connected`` but
    ``/central-robot-status`` returns ``robots: []`` — central no
    longer lists this robot as a producer for the authenticated user
    while the relay still holds its SSE channel open. From the outside
    this manifests as "the robot is online but no one can call it"
    until someone restarts the daemon.

    Common triggers:
      - the relay attached with a token that has since been rotated;
      - a transient error during ``setPeerStatus`` went unnoticed.

    Unlike ``notify_token_change``, this skips the
    ``old_token == new_token`` early-return and always reconnects,
    which is exactly what callers of ``POST /api/hf-auth/refresh-relay``
    need (their whole reason for invoking is the token did not change
    but the producer registration was lost). Goes through the relay's
    own reconnect path — works with any token shape currently stored
    (raw user tokens, OAuth access tokens) without re-validation.

    Returns:
        ``True`` if a reconnect was actually kicked off, ``False`` if
        there was no relay instance to reconnect (e.g. Lite-only build,
        daemon not yet up). HTTP callers (mobile auto-heal flow) must
        surface this distinction so they can stop waiting on a
        reconnect that will never happen.
