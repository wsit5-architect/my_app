"""Conversation-aware context for custom tools.

ToolContext is the Layer 2 counterpart to TriggerContext. It wraps a
Conversation and exposes conversation capabilities — identity and a
per-conversation key-value store — to tools that opt in by declaring
a ``ToolContext``-typed parameter.

Tools that do not declare a ``ToolContext`` parameter are unaffected.
The ToolRunner handles detection at registration time and injection at
execution time; schema generation automatically hides the ``ToolContext``
parameter from the model.

Example::

    from google.antigravity.tools.tool_context import ToolContext

    def my_tool(query: str, ctx: ToolContext) -> str:
        \"\"\"Searches and records the query in conversation state.\"\"\"
        ctx.set_state("last_query", query)
        return f"Searching for {query}..."
"""

from typing import Any

from google.antigravity.conversation import conversation as conversation_module


class ToolContext:
  """Conversation-aware context injected into tools that request it.

  Modeled after ``TriggerContext``, this handle wraps a ``Conversation``

  ``ToolContext`` is created per session and shared across all tools.

  Per-conversation state (``get_state`` / ``set_state``) persists for
  the lifetime of the ``ToolContext`` instance (i.e., the session).
